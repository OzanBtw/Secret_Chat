# Secret Chat


Do you want to make encrypted messages? Then this is the perfect tool for you! 

    First, set a seed. Seed is the key for encryption, if you don't have the right seed for the right message, you won't be able to decode your encrypted message.

    Then, enter your secret message, the one you want to encrypt. Click 'Translate' and you will get your encrypted message at the right box.
    
    If you want to decode, it is same as encoding, but you must do it at the bottom line this time.

In order to run the script, please run **'main.py'**.
